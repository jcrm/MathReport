\section{Introduction}\label{sc:Intro}
The purpose of this project is to create an application that involves 3D rigid body dynamics more specifically an application that simulates the general motion of a rigid body when an impulse force is added to the object at a particular location.
This application will take the users mouse input and draw a ray to the object on screen.
Once the user clicks the left mouse button a force will be applied to the object at the location where the ray and object collide.
This force will be instant and will cause the cube to move in the game world.
Before talking more about the actual mechanics and implementation of the application the next section will talk about some of the background equations that are needed in general motion of rigid bodies.
