\subsection{Centre Of Mass:}
The centre of mass or the centre of gravity is the point in an object when cut in two will result in two objects with the same weight \citep{millington2007game}. 
\citet{millington2007game} also describes how to calculate the centre of mass.
The object must be split into particles so that the average position can be calculated. 
\begin{equation}\label{Centre of Mass}
   G=\frac{1}{M}\sum _{n}{p}_{i}{m}_{i} 
\end{equation}
Where $G$ is the position of the centre of mass, $M$ is the mass of the entire object, ${p}_{i}$ is the position of the particle and ${m}_{i}$ is the mass of each particle.
For certain shapes such as cuboids and spheres with uniform density the centre of mass is the centre of the shape \citep{millington2007game}.

\begin{equation} \label{eq:Centre of Mass x-Component}
	\centering
   G_{x}=\frac{1}{M}\int\!\int\!\int x\ dx dy dz
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Centre of Mass y-Component}
	\centering
   G_{y}=\frac{1}{M}\int\!\int\!\int y\ dx dy dz
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Centre of Mass z-Component}
	\centering
   G_{z}=\frac{1}{M}\int\!\int\!\int z\ dx dy dz
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Centre of Mass Equation}
	\centering
   \mathbf{G}=(G_{x},G_{y},G_{z})
\end{equation}
