\subsection{Inertia Tensor:}\label{sc:IT}
The inertia tensor, which is sometimes called the mass matrix, is a 3x3 matrix which hold the characteristics of a rigid body.
This including the moment of inertia for each of its axes stored along the diagonal of the matrix and the products of inertia \citep{millington2007game}.
\citet{millington2007game} describes the products of inertia as the “tendency of an object to rotate in a direction in which torque is being applied.”
An example of the phenomena is given as a child's top that starts spinning in one direction but will then suddenly jump upside and spin in another direction \citep{millington2007game}. 

Equation \ref{ma:Inertia Tensor} is the inertia tensor matrix with the previously mention diagonal moments of inertia and the remaining values representing the products of inertia.
$A$, $B$, $C$ or equation \ref{eq:Moments of Inertia} are the moments of inertia, while $F$, $G$, $H$ are the products of inertia or equation \ref{eq:Product of Inertia}. 
\begin{equation}\label{ma:Inertia Tensor}
	\begin{bmatrix}
	  A & -H & -G \\
	  -H & B & -F \\
	  -G & -F & C
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Moments of Inertia}
	A=\sum\rho\left({y}^{2}+{z}^{2}\right)
	\qquad
	B=\sum\rho\left({x}^{2}+{z}^{2}\right)
	\qquad
	C=\sum\rho\left({x}^{2}+{y}^{2}\right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Product of Inertia}
	F=\sum\rho\left(yz\right)
	\qquad
	G=\sum\rho\left(xz\right)
	\qquad
	H=\sum\rho\left(xy\right)
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:AB Triple Integral} - \ref{eq:GH Triple Integral} show the triple integrals needed to calculate the inertia tensor for any object that has uniform density. 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:AB Triple Integral}
	A=\iiint_{V} \rho({y}^{2}+{z}^{2})\  dx dy dz
	\qquad
	B=\iiint_{V} \rho({x}^{2}+{z}^{2})\ dx dy dz
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:CF Triple Integral}
	C=\iiint_{V} \rho({x}^{2}+{y}^{2})\ dx dy dz
	\qquad
	F=\iiint_{V} \rho(yz)\ dx dy dz
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:GH Triple Integral}
	G=\iiint_{V} \rho(xz)\ dx dy dz
	\qquad
	H=\iiint_{V} \rho(xy)\ dx dy dz
\end{equation}
The inertia tensor and angular velocity are used in The Euler Equations to calculate the amount of torque needed to have an object rotate about a pivoted part of itself \citep{mactaggart2013l8}.
The equations to achieve this are equations \ref{eq:Gamma1} - \ref{eq:Gamma3} with $A$, $B$ and $C$ representing the principal moments of inertia, $\omega_{1}$, $\omega_{2}$, $\omega_{3}$ being the $xyz$ components of the angular velocity $\boldsymbol\omega$, and $\Gamma_{1}$, $\Gamma_{2}$, $\Gamma_{3}$ are the components of the total moments of all the forces $\Gamma$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Gamma1}
	A\dot{\omega_{1}} - (B-C)\omega_{2}\omega_{3} = \Gamma_{1}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Gamma2}
	B\dot{\omega_{2}} - (C-A)\omega_{3}\omega_{1} = \Gamma_{2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Gamma3}
	C\dot{\omega_{3}} - (A-B)\omega_{1}\omega_{2} = \Gamma_{3}
\end{equation}
These equations are not used in the application and would only be used if functionality were to be added which would allow the user to set a point on the object which is fixed so that it would pivot around it.
