\subsection{Rigid Body:}\label{sc:RigidBody}
A rigid body can be described as a system of particles in which each particle remains the same distance from every other particle in that system.
This means that the shape retains its shape and size whilst moving or that if there are any changes it is so small it is negligible or can be safely neglected.
Also because the particles don't move within the system the objects distribution of mass is kept (\citeauthor{bourg2013physics}, \citeyear{bourg2013physics}; \citeauthor{mactaggart2013l5}, \citeyear{mactaggart2013l5}).
